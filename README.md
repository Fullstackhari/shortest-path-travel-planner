# shortest-path-travel-planner
The Shortest Path Travel Planner is a web-based app that finds the shortest route between cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. It models cities as nodes and routes as weighted edges based on travel time. It also provides route-wise insights like places to visit and famous foods for all cities in the path.
